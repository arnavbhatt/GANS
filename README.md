This repository showcases implementations of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) from scratch. It includes:

Vanilla GAN: A basic GAN model demonstrating the fundamental concepts of adversarial training.

Wasserstein GAN (WGAN): An improved GAN variant addressing issues like mode collapse and training instability by using the Wasserstein distance as a loss function.
